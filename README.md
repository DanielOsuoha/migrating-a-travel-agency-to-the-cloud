# Cloud Migration Analysis for Cloud Climbers Travel Agency

## Executive Summary

Cloud Climbers Travel Agency aims to migrate its infrastructure to the cloud to address scalability, cost, security, and data accessibility challenges. This report provides a detailed analysis of different cloud migration options based on the 6 R's framework: Rehost, Refactor, Rearchitect, Retire, and Retain. Recommendations are made based on factors such as cost, performance, security, ease of migration, and business impact.

## Current Situation

Cloud Climbers operates on an on-premise data center with physical servers and databases. Challenges include scalability limitations, maintenance overheads, security concerns, and data management issues. Applications slated for migration include the booking platform, customer portal, CMS, CRM system, and accounting software. Data to migrate encompasses customer data, booking data, content assets, and financial records.

## Analysis of Cloud Migration Options

### Rehost (Lift and Shift)

- **Pros:** Simple, fast, minimal code changes.
- **Cons:** May not leverage full cloud benefits, potential inefficiencies.

### Refactor

- **Pros:** Improved performance, scalability, and cost efficiency.
- **Cons:** More complex and time-consuming, requires development expertise.

### Rearchitect

- **Pros:** Faster implementation, automatic updates, leverages cloud features.
- **Cons:** Vendor lock-in, potential loss of customization, may not meet specific needs.

### Retire

- **Pros:** Simplifies infrastructure, reduces cost, eliminates security vulnerabilities.
- **Cons:** May lose functionality, requires careful evaluation and planning.

### Retain

- **Pros:** Maintains control, addresses specific needs.
- **Cons:** Increased complexity, hybrid cloud management overhead.

## Evaluation Factors

- **Cost:** Total cost of ownership (TCO) in each scenario.
- **Performance:** Scalability, latency, and overall application performance.
- **Security:** Compliance requirements, data protection measures.
- **Ease of Migration:** Time, resources, and complexity involved.
- **Business Impact:** Potential disruption to operations and customer experience.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made:

- **Rehost:** Booking platform, customer portal. Utilize AWS EC2 or Azure Virtual Machines for easy migration.
- **Refactor:** CMS, CRM system. Consider AWS Lambda or Azure Functions for serverless architecture.
- **Rearchitect:** Accounting and financial management software. Explore AWS Managed Services or Azure SQL Database for cloud-native solutions.
- **Retire:** Decommission redundant applications. Utilize AWS CloudFormation or Azure Resource Manager for infrastructure management.
- **Retain:** Maintain certain on-premise applications for compliance and integration needs. Implement hybrid cloud solutions with AWS Outposts or Azure Stack.

## Conclusion

A hybrid approach combining rehosting, refactoring, and rearchitecting is recommended to optimize cost, performance, and security while minimizing disruption to operations. Cloud Climbers should prioritize migration efforts based on business-criticality and resource availability.

## Next Steps

- Develop a detailed migration plan for each application/data type.
- Allocate resources and budget accordingly.
- Monitor and evaluate the migration process to ensure successful implementation.
